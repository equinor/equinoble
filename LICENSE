### Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive  
Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent  
owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of authorship and/or a database  
(each, a “Work”). Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work  
for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific  
works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of  
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute  
as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without  
limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to  
promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural  
and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in  
part through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other purposes and  
motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or  
compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent  
that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily  
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with  
knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning  
and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

#### 1. Copyright and Related Rights

A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or  
neighboring rights (“Copyright and Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights  
include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,  
perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; (ii) moral rights retained by the  
original author(s) and/or performer(s); (iii) publicity and privacy rights pertaining to  
a person’s image or likeness depicted in a Work; (iv) rights protecting against unfair  
competition in regards to a Work; (v) rights protecting the extraction, dissemination,  
use and reuse of data in a Work; (vi) database rights; and (vii) other similar, equivalent  
or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty.

#### 2. Waiver

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer  
hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,  
and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and  
causes of action, whether now known or unknown, in the Work (i) in all territories  
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty, (iii) in any  
current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose  
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional  
purposes. Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large  
and to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver  
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal  
or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public.

#### 3. Public License Fallback

Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective  
under applicable law, then (i) the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent  
permitted, and (ii) to the extent the Waiver is so judged, Affirmer hereby grants to each  
affected person a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,  
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and Related  
Rights in the Work under the same broad terms as the Waiver.

#### 4. Limitations and Disclaimers

1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered,  
   licensed or otherwise affected by this document.  
2. Affirmer offers the Work “as-is” and makes no representations or warranties of any  
   kind concerning the Work, including without limitation any warranties of title,  
   merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.  
3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply  
   to the Work, including any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.  
4. Affirmer understands that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has  
   no duty or obligation with respect to the use of the Work.
